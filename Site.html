        <h5>About</h5>
        <h6>My name is Alice and I'm a web developer!</h6>
        <p>I am studying in 10th grade and I am passionate about design. I always liked to create different layouts and visual compositions. So recently I started to learn web design and website development. It is such a fascinating field! I love experimenting with colours, typography and markup. I want to master not only design, but also the basics of programming. I hope that in time I will learn how to create full-fledged websites. If you are also interested in design - let's communicate! I will be glad to share my ideas.</p>
